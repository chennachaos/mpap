Welcome to MPAP FSI CutFEM's documentation!
===========================================

Hello! Welcome to the FSI solver based on CutFEM.

The finite element formulation is published in 3 papers in `CMAME <https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/computer-methods-in-applied-mechanics-and-engineering>`_ journal.

* `Paper 1 <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782516304893>`_
* `Paper 2 <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782516313706>`_
* `Paper 3 <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782518301026>`_


Animations of some of the simulations performed using this code are available on my `YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9IBrbGcgPbK2frCdXdOvCH4YwHRhiVts>`_ channel.
